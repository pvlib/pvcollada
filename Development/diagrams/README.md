The diagrams in this folder describe the PVCollada 2.0 format step by step in a more visual way, based on the sample file "04 - TrackersPVC2_with_basic_electrical_layout.pvc".
The idea is to show a working model that separates the 3D part from the electrical part (circuit and strings) as much as possible.
